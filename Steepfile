# This setup assumes you are using `rbs collection` to manage RBS for gems.
# Run `rbs collection install` to install the RBS files.
# Steep will automatically pick up the RBS files from the collection.

# Default target for the main application code
target :app do
  # Where to find application-specific RBS files
  signature "sig"

  # Directories to type check
  check "app"
  check "lib"

  # Ignore generated or less critical files
  ignore "lib/tasks/**/*.rake"
  ignore "lib/protobuf/**/*"

  # Set the default diagnostic level.
  # :strict is a good goal, but :default is a good starting point.

# Target for the test suite

  # Where to find test-specific RBS files

  # Directory to type check
